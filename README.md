# Universal React-Redux Starter

This is an example of using React, React Router, and Redux in a universal (or
isomorphic) context.

You may reference this project to learn how to build web apps that render on
both a client and a server. You may also use this project as a starting point
for your own universal app.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/knicklabs/universal-react-redux-sample`

2. Change into the project directory and install the dependencies

`cd universal-react-redux-sample && npm install`

3. Run the development server

`npm start`

4. Visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see the results

## Acknowledgements

The inspiration to create this starter app came from a long and exhaustive
search for an existing example/starter app that I could use as the basis for
creating universal JavaScript applications. The starter apps that I found
tended to fall into one of two categories: (1) incomplete or (2) convoluted.
The convoluted examples were difficult to learn from and included a lot of
their authors' opinions encapsulated as dependencies. In such cases, it was a
matter of either: (a) forging ahead with a stack that I may not have chosen for
myself, or (b) spending vast amounts of time to understand a project so that I
could refactor it into something that I wanted to work with.

I set out to create a starter app that was very simple and had few dependencies.
Alex Fedoseev wrote an excellent four-part series on [building a universal
JavaScript app with React, Redux and Ruby on Rails](https://medium.com/@alexfedoseev/isomorphic-react-with-rails-part-i-440754e82a59#.2pbajkd1w).
I borrowed heavily from the ideas and sample code in this article, adapting it
to my own personal preferences and pairing it back a bit into what I consider
a good starting point for creating an application. I haven't made too many
decisions for those who take this code and run with it to build something of
their own. They will find ample freedom to easily take this project in the
direction of their choosing.
